# Windows Services Export Tool

*This is a command-line utility which can operate under standard user privileges.*

#### Example usage:

C:\Users\Username\Downloads>**wsetc services.reg**

*The output is in standard registry file format and provides some other useful information such as OS/Kernel version and total number of services.*

*Comparisons of consecutive service dumps can be performed with something like WinMerge.*
